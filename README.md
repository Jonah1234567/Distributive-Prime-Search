# Distributive-Prime-Search
Finding large Mersenne primes with Distributive's distributed compute protocol with both JavaScript and Python. The JavaScript code works with DCP's normal protocol but the Python part works with Bifrost. This project also measured the speed of Python, JavaScript, DCP and Bifrost with finding Mersenne Primes.

These are the results of the benchmarking performed:

More in depth benchmarking to be done in the future!
